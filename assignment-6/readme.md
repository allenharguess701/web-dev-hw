### B.) Briefly share your design process for this assignment. What graphic or graphics did you choose, from what decade? How did you try to style your "art page" to reflect your exploration of this decade's design trends?

I chose the 1970's decade. I looked a many psychedelic art pieces from the decade and decide that I would follow the chaotic yet ordered sort of flowing art that was reflected in much of that style. I then created a concept art graphic using the provided graphics elements. I used that as a map to get a relatively close representation in the html document. I decide early on to use the z-index: tag to allow me to layer all of the elements and divs. I also created a multicolored background to give the page a little more depth.

### C.) Describe your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.

The colors I chose were used for the individual divs.

74e700 - light green
de2f9e - purple
fff600 - Yellow

I took these colors directly from the background image I created to this assignment. They were close too some of  the colors of the provided graphics.

### D.) Work Flow
For the most part I just followed the assignment outline. I had no real problems. I created the directory and added the files from the resource zipfile. I used Dreamweaver create the index and Photoshop CC to create and optimize the image files that were not provided.

I basically just created a series of divs that were positioned and styled using CSS id's I did similar styling, sizing, and positioning with the graphic elements. I used a not widely used CSS tag to style the text to make it blink. I had originally just created an 800 by 800 px. splash art page but my daughter said it looked like a 1970's album cover so I added in the other text elements to make it an alternate version of a Cool and the Gang album.
