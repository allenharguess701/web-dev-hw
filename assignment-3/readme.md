### B.) How many <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?

The <head> tag can have several elements including <title>, <style>, <link>, and various <meta> elements. <title> is used to give a page a title. <style> embeds a CSS sheet into a page while <link> links to a separate CSS style sheet. The various <meta> elements can be used to do among other things, the following; Define the character set used, Define a description of your web page, Define keywords for search engines, Define the author of a page, Refresh the webpage, or set the viewport.

### C.) Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.

Markup is “semantic” when tags are chosen according to what they mean. For example, tagging a headline h1 because it is the most important headline on the page is a semantic authoring practice. Tagging a headline h1 “to make it look big” is not. … I use the phrase “structural markup” to mean pretty much the same thing as “semantic markup.” (“Structural markup” takes its name specifically from the idea that the web document has an outline-like structure.)

### D.) Work Flow
For the most part I just followed the assignment outline. I had no real problems. I created the directory and added the files from the resource zipfile. I used Dreamweaver t his time to edit the index and support files.
