### B.) What is "alt text," and why do we use it?

Alt text or alternative text, is a description of an image that is inserted
as an attribute in an HTML image tag that tells users the nature what can be
seen in the image. The alt text appears in a box that would normally contain
the image.

### C.) Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?

I've come across or created many types of forms with different purposes. in general forms
gather information that is processed by a server side script or other scripts into a format
usable by the webmaster. They are also typically also used to allow users to log into any
applicable user accounts.


### D.) Work Flow
For the most part I just followed the assignment outline. I had no real problems. I created the directory and added the files from the resource zipfile. I used Dreamweaver edit the index and
Photoshop CC to optimize the image file.
