## My Experience With this site

It has been a while since I've done suchan extensive static site. I Had forgotten just how challenging it can be, esepcially since I was unable to ulitize PHP or and database driven applications to sort data and pages more effectively.
in all though I found ir fun and ended up with a fairly extensive website that mimics an exsiting project I have been working on.

## Work Flow    

I started this project by creating a new directory for the project, including the images folder and other folders for the different pages and information
blurps. I created the index page using the div tags; although I did not embed the primary CSS into the page. I instead used a linked CSS file that all
of the pages used. I then used a blank version of this index page to create all the other pages and keep the theme fully intact from page to page.  

To keep the information sorted I created an images directory for all images, a pages directory for the primary instructable pages, a page_parts directory for the popup information 
blurps and two other similar directories for other types of information segments. I place the style.css file in its own directory as well.

In total I created 49 pages that make up the website that includes the instructable. For easy of use I inclued a notes section on the main index page
for the instructors, TA's, and classmates to easily find their way to the instrucable itself.


Once the site was completed, I created this readme.md file and them uploaded and debugged the project.
