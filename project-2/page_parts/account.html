<h4>Accountability:</h4>
Know where everyone is always. This is especially imporant at the onset of an emergency situation or a disaster. Tally up a list of places and
phone numbers of all the important/frequented places your framily or group might be ony given day. At school or work, or any other regularly 
visited place. Aslo have alternative means of communications should cell services go down. <br><br>
For the most part a natural disaster or an attack of some sort will be the only instances where things will go south in a hurry. 
Coordinate as best you can. If it should happen that communication do go down, everyone should follow the same plan laid out to get everyone 
to a Primary Rally Point. Again, ideally that location should be home but that may not be an option. <br><br>

Everyone within your group must be taken into consideration when designing you SM Scenarios. Their usual habits, work sites, schools attended, 
and general commutes to and from those places, along with schedules. Getting everyone to one safe location at the onset of a situation is you 
first concern. <br><br>
Communications may not be available or reliable. Best case you have communications and can coordinate with everyone. At worst you can't 
communicate at all. Plan for both cases. <br><br> 
The example below will assume a worst case scenario exists since the alternative is easily done through regular communications. Have a route 
planned for each person to get to your Primary Rally Point based on where their usual re-occurring locations are and to at least three Alternate
 Rally Points. If the Primary Rally Point is not an option then they should make their way to the Alternate Rally Point followed in turn by each 
 successive rally point. Avoid public transportation, known high traffic areas, and areas of high pedestrian congestion when planning your 
 routes and choosing Rally Points. More often than not an indirect or roundabout route will prove to be more affective. Think safe and secluded. 
 <br><br>
Have a place for individuals to leave messages every Rally Point. It should be hidden or secured in some manner. Something as simple as a 
zip-lock containing a note pad and pencil could stashed, perhaps buried in the ground next a known landmark. Set a specific arrival time for 
each rally points. A cutoff, one that is realistic for your people to get there in a pinch. This deadline will be used by those who do make it 
to any given rally point and will allow them to determine who have not, or have had to travel to the Alternate Rally Point.  <br><br>
If you find you have people missing you'll be faced with your first difficult decision. Do you make for the Alternate Rally Point and hope to 
extract your missing people there? Always wait until the cutoff time of the current rally point before doing so. Several things will affect 
this decision directly. Remember; first and foremost, the reason for the Alternate Rally Points is to give your people a safe secluded place 
to lay low. Their use by you as a means of finding one another is secondary. <br><br>
CAPD may preclude you from leaving for a Secondary Rally Point, but that's ok. It is every members responsibility to get to the Primary Rally 
Point anyway. Also, if CAPD exists you and they will more likely be better off staying put temporarily. additionally if you are relegated to 
traveling on foot, any CAPD will be much more hazardous.<br><br>
If you do elect find your missing people, do not take their Bugout Bag(s) with you. You will not know if they are in route. Better that the gear be left for them to find, than them get there and need it and not have it.
