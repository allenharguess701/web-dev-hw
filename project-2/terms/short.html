<h4>Short Term:</h4>
So; Short Term SM's, really the key here is riding it out until rescue and relief agencies get to you. Water, Food, and Safe Shelter are the 
only concerns. In this term you can afford to be more liberal in your how much you help your community. Services are on the way. 
<br><br>
Most people can easily prep for a short-term disaster. First quantify the needs of your family or group. Water has the most weight. Generally 
speaking, people can only survive about a week without water. However, that really depends on the weather conditions, your level of body fat, 
and your general health status. If you are living in a hot climate, if you are obese, or sick the amount of time you can survive without water 
can be greatly reduced. Water is the largest single component of the human body and it is essential for life. Generally speaking, you have to 
think about water in three respects; consumption, hygiene, and general usage such as cleaning laundry, dishes, etc. <br><br>
About three gallons of water per person per day for all of those considerations is a good idea. Remember this is for a healthy, fit person living 
in a temperate environment. A good way to store water in a pinch is to fill up your bath tub if you have one. Another trick is to keep 50 gallon 
garbage cans stored in a clean dry place. When the situation arises, rinse them out fill them up and cap them with their lids. Stored empty the 
cans will take up relatively little space. Filled up they will take up a moderate amount of space depending on their numbers but the ease of 
storage and their capacity will make the space they take up well worth it. Having property with a well is really the best bet; although, you 
will want to make sure you have a manual means of pumping the water out, and/or a solar cell to power an electric pump. More on water purification 
and storage later. <br><br>
The average diet is based on 2400 calories per day. What you have to remember is that this is based on a normal stress level lifestyle and a 
balanced diet. In a survival situation you are usually in a high stress level environment and you may not be eating a balanced diet. You have 
to account for this. In the field US troops will eat three MREs daily which provide an average of 1,250 calories each, (13% protein, 36% fat, 
and 51% carbohydrates). That is 3,750 calories daily. The higher calories compensate for the high-stress, high-excursion environment of field 
combat.<br><br>
Another thing you must consider is the resting metabolic rates of the members of your group. The resting metabolic rate is the number of 
calories you eat that sustains your current body weight without any real excursion on your part. A person weighting 160lbs will have a 
substantially less RMR than a person double that weight. That means the fat guy needs more calories to maintain his body weight and greatly 
diminishing his calorie intake suddenly can pose problems. Base the calorie intake of the individuals of your group on the amount of physical 
labor that they do. If the person in your group is highly active they will need more calories to survive and more importantly stay healthy. 
Again, in a short term disasters you can afford to be more liberal in this area, but you must be sure it will truly be a short term situation 
or you could be in real trouble. You should plan on a 2400 calorie/day diet for normal members of your group and at least a 3500 calorie/day 
diet for members who are active or doing a lot of physical labor. <br><br>
Safe shelter is kind of a complicated stitch. In some situations you may be forced to evacuate your home. This event will be hard to plan for 
and will really tax your ability to store and or transport food and water. Natural disasters like that of super storm Sandy are a good example. 
Severe flooding of that kind will almost always result in evacuation. Your choice of where you live will play heavily on this eventuality. First
 off don't live in or near a flood plain. That's always a bad idea. If you must live near the coast, choose an area of high ground. West coast 
 areas prone to earth quakes can also result in a forced evacuation. Again, your choices will greatly affect you.
Plan for an evacuation; both on foot and by vehicle. Having your supplies well organized and packaged will help you in loading and transporting 
them if you need to. You should also plan for an evacuation in earnest. If you must leave in a hurry, you should have a bugout bag already 
prepared for each member of your group. Having each person carry their supplies will make things much easier and will allow for much more 
supplies to be carried. We will go into greater detail on bugout bags later. <br><br>
For this instance let us suppose that you will be staying in your home. The first thing you should do is make the solid decision to hunker down. 
In most short term disasters, it is far better to stay put that bugout. That decision really should be based on CAPD and only you can make that 
decision. Second thing to do is secure your water supply and food. Make any last-minute purchases to top off these supplies as quickly and 
efficiently as you can. Remember to buy only non-perishables. Also remember that all retailers, grocery or otherwise, are resupplied upwards of
three times weekly. recources from retailers will quickly be depleted. <br><br>
Secure your home. Remember the real threat here isn't the zombies, it is other humans. Zombies have no problem-solving skills and are fairly 
dim. They are much more easily dispatched or more importantly avoided than humans are. Home security is a topic I will cover in detail later.<br><br>
Now you're set to ride out what ever disaster you're faced with. Communication with or from the outside world should be a primary concern for 
you. You need to know what's going on with any rescue and relief efforts and updates to the situation at hand. Intel on your situation is vital.
If you can help it, limit your time away from home. The more you're out, the more likely you will present yourself to danger and possible injury
 or even death. Your situational awareness is another primary concern you will need to accommodate. Keep on the lookout for local police, 
 emergency services, and other local, state or federal relief agencies. They will undoubtedly show up on your doorstep. Keep a watch out for 
 intruders. Criminals will take advantage of the situation to loot anything they can. Take nothing for granted. Given the situation you cannot 
 apply normal logic and happenstance to anything. Adapt to the changing situation and believe me the situation will develop rapidly. For better 
 or worse it will be rapid.<br><br>
Now let's make a few final notes on the short-term SM. Reassess your situation every couple of days or more often if you deem it necessary. 
Reassess every aspect of your survival. If water services are not disrupted, top off your reserves often. Don't hesitate to protect your home 
and your group with deadly force as necessary. I'll talk a little bit about use of appropriate force later. In a short-term situation and as 
time passes things will get easier. Services will at worst come back on line slowly. Order will be restored and normal civic operations will 
resume. As I said earlier, in a short-term situation you can afford to be a little bit more liberal in helping your neighbors and your 
community. Do the right thing, just make sure you aren't putting yourself at risk, but I really don't need to tell you that; do I.
