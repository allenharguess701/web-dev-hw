<h4>Long Term:</h4>
Ok so on to Long Term Situations. Really, you're going to start out in exactly the same way as you would with a short-term situation. The big 
difference is you will; at some point within the Prodromal Time Coeffient, realize that it's going to be a long while before you can expect 
any real assistance. There are very few natural disasters that will cause such a thing to occur. It would have to be something that affects 
a good portion of the continent and sorely stresses the resources of the country. At any rate, should you be faced with such a situation you 
will face the same challenges as before. You'll just need to shift into a higher survival gear so to speak. Storing food and water is a mute 
point. Eventually your supplies will run out. You'll need a renewable food and water source. Again; for water, a well is the best bet but a 
nearby lake or river will work. The key here is threefold; aquisition, purification, and storage.<br><br>
You will need to have the ability to make as few trips as possible, for each time you go to collect water you will expose yourself to CAPD. 
This poses the problem of collection capacity. You really should have the ability to collect sufficient water to last a minimum of a week. 
More if you can muster it. After tackling that issue focus on the problem of purification. Boil all water before use at a minimum. Have a 
process in place to purify the water of any microbes and bacteria. Water purification is a big topic so I'll get on that later. Just remember 
that all of your water must be purified. You will get sick just as easily by bathing in or washing your things in unpurified water as you 
would by drinking it. <br><br>
A renewable food supply will pose just a big of a problem as water. You have three ways to go about this; Farm, Raise Livestock, or Gather, 
Hunt, & Fish. The latter three should be thought of as a supplement to the first two.<br><br>
Only a limited number of people can congregate without quickly exhausting the local food supplies when a hunter gatherer approach is used as 
a means to solve the renewable food source problem. In climates that can support agriculture, farmland will support population densities 60 
to 100 times greater than land left uncultivated. If we look to the anthropological data in North America we find that the traditional peoples 
used on average, about 10 square miles per person as hunter gatherers. 10 square miles is 6,400 acres - that is for just one person.<br><br>
Farming dramatically reduces the land requirements necessary to sustain a single person. A great method to employ is a system called 
"Bio-Intensive Gardening". The Bio-Intensive method has been implemented worldwide to alleviate hunger and malnutrition since the 1970's when 
a guy named John Jeavons came up with the concept. There is a wealth of information on the Bio-intensive method. The book How To Grow More 
Vegetables Than You Ever Thought Possible On Less Land Than You Can Imagined by John Jeavons is available through Amazon. <br><br>
Let's compare; the average diet with conventional farming methods requires 15,000 to 30,000 sq. ft. and is done in such a way that it 
diminishes soil, (i.e. it is not sustainable). That's for one person. Using the Bio-Intensive method approximately 8,000 sq. ft. of land is 
needed for the complete diet for one person, (4,000 sq/ft. of actual growing space and at least 4,000 sq. ft. for pathways and access). That 
is also assuming you have four growing seasons per year. So, if you can only get two growing seasons, then you need to double the space 
needed per person. For reference, an acre is 43,560 sq. ft. So, in a temperate climate, you could theoretically support about 5 people per 
acre.<br><br>
By all means; this method is not the only one out there. Do the research and find out what would work best for you. The stitch is; get that 
ability, that knowledge, get it under your belt ASAP. You'll need it. All your other needs will be similar. The real difference is going to 
be work. It's going to take a great deal more work. But that's really nothing new. This great nation was founded by hard work by those few 
people who dared to take a chance and migrate to this great land. It's been done already, that's the message to take away from all this.
So, you're probably thinking, "What's this guy thinking telling me to farm when things will get back to normal eventually?" The answer is 
simple. The extended period of time will exhaust your food stores. It's inevitable. Plus, your really won't know how long things are going to 
take to get back to normal. Additionally, as things start to return to normal you will have a resource to barter or sell to get the things 
you'll need. Remember you won't have a traditional job at that point.<br><br>
