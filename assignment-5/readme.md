### B.) Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.

Divs are block level elements t hat allow coders to organize the layout of a webpage. 
Through the use of classes; which, descibe and group elements, 
ids; which, describe elements independently, 
and the span element; which, discribes elements within an area of a div, 
The coder can manipulate a layout to allow virtually any design elements. 

### C.) Why might I consider third-party over self-hosted media?

The only reason would be cost.

### D.) Work Flow
For the most part I just followed the assignment outline. I had no real problems. I created the directory and added the files from the resource zipfile. I used Dreamweaver edit the index and
Photoshop CC to optimize the image file.
