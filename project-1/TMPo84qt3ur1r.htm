<br><br>
Suddenly at this moment I close my eyes.
A thought of you grows inside my mind.
Writing this is well worth the effort.
I forget myself.
<br><br>
I think of the rose you asked for.
Its image fills my mind.
I hope I never wake.
A daydream of roses;
I've come to see that's you.
<br><br>
The day dreams on -
<br><br>
A sunny day
Not a cloud in the sky.
Wind softly blowing.
Leaves passing me bye.
Under a bridge; dark, then back into light.
<br><br>
The day still dreaming bye, passing into the night -
<br><br>
Row upon row of roses.
You stand out in the crowd.
<br><br>
Please let me live this daydream a little while longer.
<br><br>
I see the truth upon the water.
This place for me to rest and learn and grow.
I see the truth you are the flower.
Standing where the peaceful waters flow.
<br><br>
My faith is strengthened by you don't you see.
You make it easy for me to believe.
<br><br>
A rose in the moonlight in my daydream garden.
