# My First Webpage
## Allen Harguess

I use Firefox almost exclusively; although I do some webpage testing with Chrome.

A web browser, or simply "browser," is an application used to access and view websites. The primary function of a browser is to render HTML. This is the code used to design or "mark up" webpages. Each time a browser loads a web page, it processes the HTML, which may include text, links, images, and other items, such as cascading style sheets and JavaScript functions. The browser processes these items, then renders them in the browser window.

## Wayback Machine

I searched all the way back to 1996. The website www.blizard.com a game development company that developed popular MMO's like; Diablo, Starcraft, and World of Warcraft.

The changes between the 1996 version and Dec 2017 version were of course dramatic. the actual URL changed. The graphics changed from simple buttons and static images to a fully integrated/seamless template with an adobe flash header. The number of games offered by Blizzard has obviously increased and full integration with all social media has been added. You can really see how the advancements in coding has increased the versatility and capabilities of websites.

## Work Flow    

I started this project by creating a new directory for the project, including the images folder. I created the index page using the older table, tr, and td tags. I know this older style of coding is somewhat outdated but it proves easier on simple webpages like the one for this project.   

The Content of the page is a poem I wrote several years ago and was published in a compilation book titled "An Hour At Sunset". It one of the two times I've been published. The image I got from a short google search.  

Once the index page was completed, I created this readme.md file and them uploaded and debugged the project.
