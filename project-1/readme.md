# My Intro-Web-Dev
## Allen Harguess

I have been into web-design for a number of years now and am finally getting
  my BA in media arts in order to pursue my goals of working in the industry.

-To be honest, I didn't learn anything new about the internet and what it is.

-I am interested in the idea of end to end connectability.

-I was surprised too see that many people though Bill Gates was in control of the interenet.
