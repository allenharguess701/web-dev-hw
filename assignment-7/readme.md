### B.)What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?

padding: An element's padding is the space between its content and its border.
margin: Is used to create space around elements and is defined as an area outside
of the element's borders.
border: is simply the border around the element which can be styled in many ways.

### C.) What was the hardest task for you to accomplish this assignment? For example, was it overlapping elements, working with muliple fonts, creating layout, or something else entriely?

Honestly the fonts where the real issue. overlapping divs and the elements; in this case graphics, is easy
using the z-index tag.

### D.) Work Flow
For the most part I just followed the assignment outline. I had no real problems. I created the directory and added the files from the resource zipfile. I used Dreamweaver create the index and Photoshop CC to create and optimize the image files that were not provided. Fonts were taken from google fonts.

I basically just created a series of divs that were positioned and styled using CSS id's I did similar styling, sizing, and positioning with the graphic elements. I was not able to find the exact fonts so I approximated those I found to best represent the feel of the add.
