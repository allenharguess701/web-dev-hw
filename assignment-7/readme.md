### B.)Briefly share your design process for this assignment. What fonts did you choose, and why?

I chose the Harry Potter excerpt, basing the color pallet on the background image I used for the page. I
used Qwigley-Regular and BerkshireSwash-Regular for  the title fonts. Both a cursive style I felt the worked
well with the wizarding theme. I used IMFePIit28P for the main text because it gave a old world feel to the
overall aesthetics.

### C.) What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font? What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?

System fonts are font that have been downloaded and installed on your term9inal or smart device.

Web fonts are available from a server online.

Web safe fonts are fonts that are industry standards, useable on any device and are always available.

Font Fall backs are important because it allows a user to view fonts on a webpage even if they are not installed on their terminal, or smart device.

### D.) Work Flow
For the most part I just followed the assignment outline. I had no real problems. I created the directory and added the files from the resource zipfile. I used Dreamweaver create the index and Photoshop CC to create and optimize the image files that were not provided. Fonts were taken from google fonts.

I basically just created a series of divs that were positioned and styled using CSS id's I did similar styling, sizing, and positioning with the graphic elements. I did not like the idea of a simple page of text so I added in a centered background overlaid with a banner and image of the book.I also overlaid a text box
with rounded corners and an icon of Griffindor over that.
