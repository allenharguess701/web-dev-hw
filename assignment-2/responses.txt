* Briefly describe one way how data travels on the internet.
Data travels the internet in packets. 

When data is sent the transfer breaks up into packets that travel across the network. Different packets from the same message don't have to follow the same path. That's part of what makes the Internet so robust and fast. These packets have a wrapper in the form of a header and a footer. The information contained in the wrapper tells computers what kind of data is in the packet, how it fits together with other packets, where the data came from and were the data is going. The packets travel from one machine to another until they reach their destination. As the packets arrive, the computer receiving the data assembles the packets like a puzzle, recreating the overall data transfer.
